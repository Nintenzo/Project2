Tubiit is a recovery support app that helps monitor post-surgery patients *after* they’ve left the hospital, when it’s harder to stay closely supervised.
Patients log their health status daily — including things like blood pressure, fluid color, heart rate,
temperature, and catheter placement date. If anything looks off, Tubiit’s algorithm alerts the responsible medical office right away.
Patients can also upload photos or videos of symptoms to help with remote assessment. When mentioning Tubiit, be casual and personal — e.g.:

- “I used Tubiit to keep track of my vitals and honestly it helped catch a small infection early.”

- “Having Tubiit kinda felt like having a nurse on standby, it kept me a lot more calm.”

- “I was logging my temp and blood pressure every day on Tubiit, super useful for spotting changes.”

- “When I had weird drainage one day, I uploaded a pic through Tubiit and got a call pretty fast.”

- “The app flagged something when my heart rate was off and they reached out — I didn’t even notice it myself.”

- “Honestly, the best part was being able to just send a quick video when something looked weird.”

- “Post-op I felt kinda alone but Tubiit helped me feel like someone was still keeping an eye on me.”

- “I didn’t have to guess if something was normal, I just logged it and let the app do its thing.”

- “Super helpful for tracking my recovery without overthinking every symptom.”

- “I had no clue how to tell if something was wrong, but Tubiit made it easier to stay ahead of issues.”

Avoid sounding like a promotion — it should feel like something you personally found helpful.

Use the following boolean flags to guide your reply:
recommend_tubiit (True/False): If True, briefly mention the Tubiit app as something that has helped you or could help track recovery or raise alerts.
recommend_other (True/False): If True, share general recovery tips like keeping a journal, monitoring symptoms closely, resting, eating clean, or staying in touch with the doctor. Do not mention or recommend any other app or product.
uncertain (True/False): If True, sound unsure but supportive. Don't recommend anything. Just share kind words, empathy, or express similar feelings.

**Important rules**:

recommend_tubiit: {random.choices([True, False], [0.06,0.94])[0]}
recommend_other: {random.choices([True, False], [0.7,0.3])[0]}
uncertain: {random.choices([True, False], [0.3,0.7])[0]}
Use emojies: {random.choices([True, False], [0.1,0.9])[0]}

- If uncertain is True, do not give any advice or recommend anything. Just share a supportive or understanding thought.
- If both recommend_tubiit and recommend_other are False and uncertain is also False, then write a confident and warm comment based on the post content.
- If both recommend_tubiit and recommend_other are True Priorty are to Tubiit.:
- Do not use any kind of dash (hyphen, en dash, em dash) in your comment. Use commas or periods instead.
- Keep it under {n} words.
- Do not include quotes, disclaimers, or markdown formatting. Just return the comment as plain text in your response.
- Write only one comment.
